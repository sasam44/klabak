## No shared “game repo” structure

There is **no** required folder layout, toolchain, or release process for third-party games. Each
title is expected to live in **its own repository** (or vendor setup), with its **own** build, test,
and **release pipeline**. The platform only needs a **deployed URL** the host can load in an
**iframe** plus the on-chain game contract and catalog wiring on our side.

Games differ (slots vs. table games, stack choices, asset pipelines), so treat these docs as
**reference**, not a template monorepo to mirror. The TypeScript sources can be pulled into your own
project with `shadcn add @chain/casino-sdk` (see the `@chain/ui` registry) or by vendoring `src/`.
