# Smart contract constraints (`CasinoGameFacet` + `ICasinoGameV2`)

Summarized from `packages/contracts/contracts/Casino/CasinoGameFacet.sol`, `CasinoSessionBase.sol`, `CasinoRandomnessFacet.sol`, `CasinoSessionRecoveryFacet.sol` and `CasinoRiskLib.sol`. On the diamond these facets share one storage layout and one ABI surface, so from a game's perspective they behave as a single host. Treat source files as authoritative if this doc drifts.

## Game interface

Your game **must** implement [`ICasinoGameV2`](../simulator/contracts/ICasinoGameV2.sol):

- **`quoteCaps(wager, gameData)`** — `maxEscrowStake >= wager` or `openSession` reverts. `maxReservedProfit` is used with per-session bet-risk limits (`maxBetRiskBps` vs vault liquidity).
- **`quoteRiskParams(wager, gameData)`** — Returns `maxPayout`, **`probabilityWad`** (1e18 = 100%), `expectedPayout`, `bodyVarianceScaled`.
  - `probabilityWad` must be **≤ 1e18** or `CasinoGameFacet__InvalidRiskProbability`.
  - For slots / jackpots: `probabilityWad` should reflect the **top-tier (jackpot) win probability** so the facet can apply the **tiered heavy-tail** reserve path (see `SLOTS_RISK_AND_RESERVES.md`).
  - `bodyVarianceScaled` is the **body variance**: the variance of the round's payout with the top tier removed, per bet, in the reserve's scaled units (wei² × 1e18). It is counted for every bet; return `0` only when the top tier is the sole winning outcome. (Renamed from `subJackpotVarianceScaled`; same position and type, so the ABI encoding is unchanged.) Whitelisting a game whose top multiplier exceeds the heavy-tail threshold reverts (`CasinoConfigFacet__HeavyTailGameWithoutVarianceSource`) unless it quotes a nonzero body variance or the council has set a σ floor (`setGameSigmaFloor`).
- **`onSessionStart` / `onPlayerAction` / `onRandomness`** — Pure/view step handlers; return `StepResult` with `nextPhase`, `requestRandomnessNow`, `escrowDelta`, `reservedProfitDelta`, `payout`, `outcome`, `newGameState`.
- **`quoteForfeitPayout(ctx)`** — Current cash-out value (stake + accrued winnings) derived from `ctx.gameState`; return `0` when nothing is cashable mid-round. When a session is forfeited after the action deadline the facet pays the player this quote (clamped to `escrowedStake + reservedProfit`) minus a 10% cut (`FORFEIT_WINNINGS_CUT_BPS = 1000`). The call is defensive (gas-capped staticcall, 32-byte return): if it reverts, returns malformed data, or the game predates this method, the forfeit pays `0`. Quote a real value only if your game has a true anytime cash-out fully determined by already-revealed state (mines-style); if mid-round value depends on unresolved randomness or hidden state (blackjack-style), return `0` — any quote there is an adverse-selection exploit against the vault (see `CHAIN_WTF_CASINO_GAMES.md`).
- **Unbiased d6 from `bytes32` randomness (MUST)** — If you map VRF/facet bytes to faces `1..6`, you **must** use rejection sampling (`byte < 252` then `(byte % 6) + 1`). **Do not** use raw `(randomness[i] % 6) + 1` on a byte — that is modulo-biased. See [`RANDOMNESS_DICE.md`](./RANDOMNESS_DICE.md) for canonical Solidity/TypeScript and agent checklist.

## Facet orchestration

- **Whitelist**: `CasinoGameFacet__GameNotWhitelisted` if the game address is not whitelisted (governance).
- **Vault**: Must be a protocol vault (`VaultManagerLib.isVault`); min bet checked.
- **Randomness provider** must be set on the facet or `CasinoGameFacet__RandomnessProviderNotSet`.
- **`openSession` flow**: Calls `quoteCaps` and `quoteRiskParams`, commits portfolio risk, pulls the wager from the player, then calls **`onSessionStart` once** with the real session context. Bet-risk and portfolio checks run first, so their errors take precedence over a revert from `onSessionStart`.
- **Payout**: Capped at `escrowedStake + reservedProfit` with no slack (`CasinoGameFacet__InvalidPayout`) — see [Payout cap](#payout-cap).
- **Escrow / reserved profit**: Escrow increases may be restricted (`CasinoGameFacet__EscrowIncreaseNotAllowed`); caps enforced (`EscrowCapExceeded`, `ReservedProfitCapExceeded`).
- **Phases**: Invalid transitions revert (`CasinoGameFacet__InvalidStepTransition`). Example: you cannot request randomness from a terminal phase incorrectly.
- **Reentrancy**: All value-moving entrypoints (`openSession`, `submitAction`, `onCasinoRandomnessFulfilled`, `forfeitExpiredSession(s)`, `cancelStuckRandomness`) are `nonReentrant` (OpenZeppelin `ReentrancyGuardTransient`, a diamond-safe EIP-1153 guard), and settlement finalizes session state before any token transfer (checks-effects-interactions). Game step handlers are `view` (reached via `staticcall`), so a game contract cannot reenter.

## Payout cap

Every step applies its `escrowDelta` and `reservedProfitDelta` to the session first. When the step ends the round (a terminal `nextPhase` such as `SETTLED`), the facet then requires:

```
payout <= escrowedStake + reservedProfit   // after this step's deltas
```

Otherwise the step reverts with `CasinoGameFacet__InvalidPayout(maxAllowedPayout, payout)` (`LocalCasinoHost__InvalidPayout` in the simulator). On the randomness path, the fulfillment callback reverts, so the round stays in `WAITING_RANDOMNESS` until someone calls `cancelStuckRandomness`, which refunds only the stake. The player loses the win.

Both traps below only surface on large wins, which are rare, so casual testing misses them. Test your top multiplier explicitly.

### Reserve and payout must agree to the wei

**Symptom:** only wins at the top multiplier revert with `InvalidPayout`, and `maxAllowedPayout` is a few base units below `payout`.

The reserved profit your `onSessionStart` commits (which must also stay within `quoteCaps`' `maxReservedProfit`) is the entire budget for the win. If `onRandomness` computes the payout through a separate formula, rounding can put it a base unit above that budget, and every top-multiplier win reverts. Route `quoteCaps`, `quoteRiskParams`, `onSessionStart` and `onRandomness` through one payout function so the numbers match exactly.

### Don't release reserved profit on the settling step

**Symptom:** every win above 1x reverts with `InvalidPayout`, and `maxAllowedPayout` equals the stake.

Returning a negative `reservedProfitDelta` (e.g. `-maxReservedProfit`) from the step that settles lowers the cap before the payout check, leaving only the stake. Return `reservedProfitDelta = 0` when settling: `_finalizeSession` releases the reserve itself. The same applies to a negative `escrowDelta` on the settling step. It refunds the stake and shrinks the cap by the same amount.

Releasing reserve on a non-terminal step (e.g. a mines cash-out bound dropping) is allowed, but it lowers the cap for every later payout in that session.

## Default governance constants (facet)

These are **configurable** by `SECURITY_COUNCIL_ROLE` but defaults matter for understanding behavior:

| Constant                                | Default | Meaning (high level)                                                                                          |
| --------------------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DEFAULT_ACTION_TIMEOUT_BLOCKS`         | 43200   | Player must act before this block window or forfeit path applies (payout = 90% of `quoteForfeitPayout`).      |
| `DEFAULT_RANDOMNESS_TIMEOUT_BLOCKS`     | 150     | RNG fulfillment window before cancel / stuck handling.                                                        |
| `DEFAULT_MAX_BET_RISK_BPS`              | 100     | Bet risk vs available liquidity (basis points).                                                               |
| `DEFAULT_CONFIDENCE_MULTIPLIER_BPS`     | 372     | VaR multiplier (~3.72 for 99.99% in their model).                                                             |
| `DEFAULT_SAFETY_MULTIPLIER_BPS`         | 10000   | 1.0× safety on VaR leg (no padding; the reserve is the solvency floor).                                       |
| `DEFAULT_MIN_RESERVE_RATIO_BPS`         | 1500    | Minimum reserve ratio.                                                                                        |
| `DEFAULT_HEAVY_TAIL_MULT_THRESHOLD`     | 100     | `maxPayout/wager > this` participates in heavy-tail check.                                                    |
| `DEFAULT_HEAVY_TAIL_PROB_THRESHOLD_WAD` | 1e15    | **0.1%** in WAD — jackpot probability below this triggers heavy-tail path together with multiplier threshold. |

Heavy-tail detection in library: `CasinoRiskLib.isHeavyTail(maxPayout, wager, probabilityWad, multiplierThreshold, probThresholdWad)`.

## Portfolio / insolvency

- `CasinoGameFacet__InsufficientPortfolioReserve` when the vault cannot satisfy committed portfolio reserve requirements for the new session.
- `CasinoGameFacet__InconsistentJackpotProbability` when heavy-tail jackpot stats don’t line up (game-specific invariants).

## Build

In this monorepo, contracts are built with **`pnpm build`** from `packages/evm/contracts` (not raw `hardhat compile` only) so postbuild steps run — see root `AGENTS.md`.
